# Data for replication the experiments in TARP

The folder data contains all the parameters and samples used in our experiments.

* The data contains five groups. Each group has two .csv files. The first file specifies the dynamic passenger arriving volumes at each station for each stochastic scenario. The second file specifics the cumulative volume of alighting passengers at each station for each stochastic scenario. In addition, some other related parameters are also listed in the data set.
* If you have any questions or recommedations, or if you want to know more details about the data sets and implementations in Beijing metro, please email me directly  at jtyin@bjtu.edu.cn (^_^)
